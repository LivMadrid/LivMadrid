(Liv) 🐱‍💻💃🎨🧿🌸

I come from a multi-faceted background. Since I was a child I've been  interested in people, art, dancing, and languages. 
After studying, living, and working abroad in Italy, Turkey, and Hungary I became fluent in Italian and versed in Turkish and Hungarian. 

Exploring software engineering after learning about the Python language and all the creative ways to implement it I started searching for a career where I can be creative, solve problems, help people, and utilize my language skills. I am a Software Engineer after non-linear journey of occupations:
bio-cultural anthropologist/art & Italian teacher/ magazine writer/ restaurant server & manager/ veterinary assistant. My path to becoming an SWE is non-traditional and I wouldn't have it any other way. 

I am interested in the intersection of Tech and women’s health, game development, AI development, cybersecurity(especially in the IOT), creativity, and languages(both human and computer). I strive to be part of a team to make things more efficient, joyful, and better for the world.

🎨I love to create (in code, clay, movement, ink, paint, printmaking, writing, jewelry, gardening).

🧡I love learning languages and new ways of thinking.

🧠I love thinking about consciousness and what it means to exist in this reality.

☕I love connecting with people over a meal or coffee and sharing stories.

🌵I seek discomfort for growth.
