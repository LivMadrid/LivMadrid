Olivia hails from multi-faceted background. Since Olivia was a child she was interested in people, art, dancing, and languages. 
After studying, living, and working abroad in Italy, Turkey, and Hungary she became fluent in Italian and versed in Turkish and Hungarian. 

She became interested in software engineering after learning about the Python language and all the creative ways to implement it. 
Searching for a career in which she could be creative, solve problems, help people, and utilize her language skills she found her path in software engineering. 

Olivia is interested in the intersection of Tech and women’s health, creativity, and languages and how she can be part of a team to make things more efficient
and better for the world.
